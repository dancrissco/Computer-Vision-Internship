# Computer-Vision-Internship
An AI based computer vision internship
# 🧠 Computer Vision Internship using Roboflow  
**A Not-for-Profit, Open-Source Learning Experience**  
Created by **Daniel Christadoss**  
> Learn Computer Vision from fundamentals to real-world warehouse digital twin creation.  
> Build your own dataset, train models in Roboflow, and deploy intelligent inventory systems.

## 🎯 Program Overview
This internship program introduces hobbyists, students, and innovators to **Computer Vision** and **AI-based automation**.  
Participants will begin by detecting simple objects and progress toward building a **warehouse digital twin** capable of visual inventory management.

The program is **self-paced**, **hands-on**, and **community-driven** — with guidance through posts, GitHub modules, and collaborative examples.

---

## 🧩 Learning Objectives
By the end of this program, participants will:
- Understand dataset creation, annotation, and model training using **Roboflow**.  
- Run real-time **object detection** and inference on local devices or in the cloud.  
- Manage datasets, models, and documentation using **GitHub**.  
- Integrate computer vision outputs with **inventory management systems**.  
- Develop a **capstone project**: a functional **warehouse digital twin**.
